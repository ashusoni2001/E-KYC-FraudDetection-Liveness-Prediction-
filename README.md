# E-KYC-FraudDetection-Liveness-Prediction-
This is  a Conmputer vision project, in which I aim to build a system that can be used to detect and avoid frauds during E-KYC proceduresThis project uses a neural network trained on live and not live videos and images to detect if a person is alive or fake infront of the camera, For face and eye detection I have used Haar Cascade files from openCV

To run the project 
Just install all the dependencies and then run main_code.py file using python
